# sqlalchemy-challenge

I found this assignment very difficult, and I ran out of time in the end to polish it up. I have checked all of the API routes, including the dynamic ones, and they appear to be producing the results. I initially forgot to include session.close() and then realised how important it is when refreshing the page! 

I still don't fully grasp Flask, so further practice will be needed.
